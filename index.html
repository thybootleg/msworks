            <p>I began my college journey studying film production, 
                immersing myself in the art of visual storytelling.
                 However, as I delved deeper into the world of film,
                  my curiosity for the technical aspects grew. 
                  This led me to transition to computer science, 
                  where I now explore the realm of coding, blending 
                  my passions for creativity and technology. I am 
                  excited to bridge the gap between film production 
                  and software development to create innovative 
                  digital experiences.</p>

                Throughout my diverse work experience, I have gained valuable 
                skills and insights in various industries. As a manager at a 
                fast food restaurant, I successfully oversaw daily operations, 
                ensuring the smooth running of the establishment. I adeptly 
                handled customer inquiries, resolved issues promptly, and 
                motivated a team of employees to deliver exceptional service. 
                Transitioning to the role of a bartender, I honed my 
                interpersonal and multitasking abilities, creating a vibrant 
                and welcoming atmosphere for patrons. I skillfully mixed drinks, 
                provided recommendations, and built lasting relationships with 
                customers. Additionally, my time as a moving industry surveyor 
                allowed me to develop excellent organizational and logistical 
                skills. I meticulously assessed the scope and requirements of 
                each move, ensuring accurate estimates and seamless execution. 
                These combined experiences have shaped me into a versatile 
                professional capable of adapting to various work environments 
                and effectively leading teams.</p>
